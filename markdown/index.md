## Feeling generous?

Here are a few of my favorite charities.

> Every February, I climb for charity. This year I will donate $1 for every route or boulder sent to [MICA Project](https://www.mica-project.org/). You can donate to my fundraiser [here](https://ig.me/1SsLF2kgo4a4nXz) or directly on their website.

[Donate to Project Healthy Children](https://projecthealthychildren.org/)

> Project Healthy Children fortifies food, preventing malnourishment

[Donate to Palestine Children's Relief Fund 🇵🇸](https://www.pcrf.net/)

> Around 50% of Gaza's population is children and they are facing the wrath of an indiscriminate bombing campaign.
