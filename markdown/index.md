## Feeling generous? 

Here are a few of my favorite charities.

[Donate to Catalyst Sports 2025](https://p2p.onecause.com/challengeforaccess2025/john-franke)

> Past years:
> [Catalyst Sports 2024](https://www.mightycause.com/story/Qw3r4g)
> [Paradox Sports 2023](https://paradoxsports.salsalabs.org/paradoxmileclimbnashville2023/p/johnottenlipsfranke/index.html)

> Every February, I climb for charity at Climb Nashville. Paradox Sports and Catalyst Sports both offer accessible climbing opportunities for people with differing abilities, defying the perception that people with a ‘disability’ cannot lead a life of adventure. We hit the goal in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Let's do it again in 2025! [Progress 📈](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzR7rOHaAEI6hJEl_Jkq6DBeE_NRLKLsFmJtyf-NRf8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

[Nashville Community Fridge](https://www.instagram.com/nashvillecommunityfridge) 🥕🍉🥑🍅🍇🥝🍍🍊🍌🍈🥭

> Nashville Community Fridge is a free fridge in Nashville that provides healthy fresh food for nearby residents.

[Donate to Palestine Children's Relief Fund 🇵🇸](https://www.pcrf.net/)

> Around 50% of Gaza's population is children and they are facing the wrath of an indiscriminate bombing campaign.

This blog was generated via [agave](https://github.com/jottenlips/agave), a static site generator I wrote with ReasonML that turns markdown files (.md) into custom styled html and css.

```bash
npm i -g agave-generator
# for theming your own site
mkdir markdown
cd markdown
echo '<html><body><!-- MARKDOWN --></body></html>' >> base.html
touch index.md && touch styles.css
cd ..
agave -p docs
```

And push to your GitHub io page, or upload to any other static site hosting service.

For code syntax highlighting, I am using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) in my base.html file.
