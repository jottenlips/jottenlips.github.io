# Starting the Second Half of Treatment

## October 20–23

The PET scan came back clean, and I’m officially in complete remission!!!! 
The trial sorted me into four more infusions of ABVD.

Outside of the hospital, life’s been moving fast. I got thrown off some V4s and V5s at the climbing gym (Climb So Ill), bought a house, and fought a particularly stubborn Ikea dresser through an early 1900s stairway.

Zoe and Mary came into town! We made the rounds: IMOs pizza, Blueprint Coffee, Carl’s Drive-In, Gioia's, and a few other local favorites. It was great catching up and sharing a bit of normal life again. We also carved pumpkins.

Another infusion down. 🥴

My son’s **first Halloween!** 👻 I won’t forget it. The neighborhood went all out.

## First Week of November

This week hit hard. The side effects kicked in with extreme fatigue, and I spent most of the weekend in bed sleeping. I did feel better in the evenings, though. The pain and numbness in my hands is getting worse, and it’s making typing difficult, which is frustrating.

I did manage to get out for my first bike ride since being diagnosed, riding down Wydown to Forest Park. The leaves were beautiful. I also hung up my hangboard to stretch out my fingers and set up my weights for the better days when I can move around more.

My father-in-law gave me a **vintage Cannondale mountain bike**, which I’m planning to get tuned up soon. It doesn’t need much, probably just new tires for gravel riding. I’m hoping to take it out on the **Katy Trail** this spring with my family.

Only three more infusions to go! I’m definitely feeling the cumulative effects now, but the doctor seems confident that the neuropathy will improve after treatment. ABVD has less neuropathy than the immunotherapy track, so that’s reassuring.

My guitar playing has slipped a bit because of the hand pain, but I’m staying hopeful and focused on recovery. Cannot wait to be done on December 10th. It is going to be a great Christmas.
