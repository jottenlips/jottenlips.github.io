# Side Effects (First Infusion)

## September 5

This day hit hard.

- Ocular migraines made it impossible to look at a screen. I spent the morning wearing sunglasses indoors until Tylenol kicked in, but still had some vision issues.  
- Mouth sores showed up, making it nearly impossible to eat normal food. I managed with cold pizza, watermelon, Fairlife protein shakes, and Gatorade. Brushing my teeth started to hurt.  
- A small rash developed at the injection site.  
- After a shower, I got bad muscle spasms in my chest, back, and neck. It was some of the worst pain I’ve felt—like a real-life Gom Jabbar test from *Dune*.
- Exhaustion left me weak. Even a short walk was out of the question. Instead, I drifted in and out of micro-naps until the neck and chest pain woke me.  
- Cold air outside helped the muscle pain in between wakeups.

## September 6

The morning started with some relief.

- Around 5 a.m., the chest and neck pain finally eased up, and I was able to fall back asleep.  
- Took a Tylenol immediately with my coffee to avoid a migraine.  
- The mouth pain lingered all day and got a bit worse, but the prescribed glycerin mouth rinse helped a little. More cold pizza and watermelon were on the menu. Nothing sounds good to eat.
- I went to the Clayton Art Fair with Drew down the street. We found free parking easily, walked around for a bit, and then sat together on a bench for an hour. It felt good to be out.  
- Back home, I fell into more afternoon naps.

Not excited for my next round of treatment. Hoping today and tomorrow I continue to rebound. My brother and his wife are coming into town before my next round. I am hoping for a good week with them.
