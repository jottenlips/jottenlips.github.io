# Finding Out

This is a detailed account of how I learned I had cancer. This is mostly for me and to process the events that have happed this summer. I never thought I would be someone that gets cancer young. I worked out very regularly, ate well, could run 10k, climb hard, and always fealt like I had an endless pool of energy to pull from.

# May: Not feeling great

- **May - Dad sickness?**

This entire month I was off and on sick. I would get sick, start to feel better, then something else would come up. This was mostly sinus issues and fatigue. When the rest of the family would get sick, they would only be out for a day or two. I would feel crummy the whole week. I noticed some pain on my left side when weight lifting at the YMCA. I decided to start taking it easy. At first I went to less weight, and eventually stopped going. I continued to rock climb casually with friends when I wasn't feeling sick. I even made it out to Obed once this month. The first time I got to outside climb since becoming a new dad. We had a blast.

## June: The First Signs  

- **June 15 - Fathers Day**

This month was much like May. It started with something viral, then the symptoms subsided and I was able to go to Mammoth cave on Father's Day to do the Frozen Niagara tour. We had a blast. A couple days later I took a turn for the worse developing a bacterial infection. My primary care physician reffered to this as a "double sickening". 

- **June 20 – Urgent Care**  
I finally went to an urgent care after a pretty bad ear infection. I was given steroids and antibiotics. The ear infection cleared, but my lymph nodes were still enlarged.

- **June 23 – Doctor’s Appointment**  
I had made a Dr. appointment prior to going to urgent care. This was the quickets they could see me. I went in even though I fealt fine. My symptoms had subsided besides some minor lymph node swelling.

- **June 29 – Obed**  
I woke up super early and met my good friend and belay partner at his house. We drove out to the wild and scenic Obed for a beutiful day of rock climbing, hiking, and swimming. I was projecting Heresy and finally got to the finish chains. On our hike out of the Y12 area, I became extremely fatigued after going up the ladder. I bent over for a good 2 to 3 minutes to catch my breth. It was a warm summer day and we had heavy packs on, but this is not typical behavior for me. After catching my breath, the rest of the day was fine. We got home early in the afternoon and I hung out with my wife and baby the rest of the day.

## July: Clues Start Appearing  
- **July 12 – Band Practice**  
The bumps were still on my neck and collarbone. My friend Willa had asked where I wanted to stand for band practice. I said I need to sit down since I can't wear a guitar strap. I showed her the bumps on my collarbone. She said I should get it looked at. I had already scheduled an appointment early next week. Other symptoms were starting to develop and interfere with my day to day life, like full body itching.

- **July 14 - Google**
When I googled my symptoms, the same thing kept coming up: lymphoma. I slacked my friends about it, they calmed my fears down. Everyone knows Google will tell you the worst case

- **July 15 – Ultrasound & Appointment**  
I went in for my Dr. appointment. I told her my symptoms. She said that it appears to be a drastic change from the previous symptoms I had. She thought it could be a mixture of a new allergy and anxiety from being sick the previous month. I went in for an ultrasound that day.



- **July 22-23 – Telehealth Call and Ultrasound results**  
The ultrasound results came back strange. The radiologist suggested it was simple a vascular complex or some sort of vascular disorder I was born with. I had some pictures of my neck from a trip to Mexico in January, I was definitely not born with this. I got my Dr. to schedule me a CT. This wasn't expedited since the ultrasound results did not look super serious. In the meantime, I continued life as normal and fought through the symptoms. The allergist had me up my anti-histimine dosage to help the itching. This seemed to mask the symptoms for a while.

At work we finally launched our new mobile app. This project was a huge goal of ours for the year. Getting the app out into the world was a huge source of tranquilty and relief. Mentally, I was feeling very positive and had a great time hanging with our team that had flown in from all over the world. Physically, I was feeling pretty rough and my shoulder and neck were getting worse. I took a plane ride to St. Louis that night, then we drove to Wisconsin for a family vacation the next morning. I thought taking a whole week off in the fresh Wisconsin north woods air could potentially fix my immune system and calm my health anxiety.

## August: Everything Escalates  
- **August 4 – CT Scan**  
I went in for my CT scan, it was the children's underwater themed one which made me cry.

- **August 5 – Coughing Blood**  
H*ly shit I need to go the ER. As soon as I had calmed down, I took my wife's car and went to the ER and she took him to daycare that morning.

- **August 5–8 – Hospital Stay**  
I was admitted, they put a camera down my throat, took another CT, and found a mass in my chest and neck. It is in a place they were not able to surgically remove it. Over the next four days, I had two surgical biopsies and met with several oncologist and cancer specialist. They put me through a lot of other tests due to my recent exposure to caves. One possibility was histoplasmosis, but having all the oncologist around, I had the feeling they already knew what it was. The allergist called me before a surgery, apparently I also have Alpha Gal and am allergic to red meat.

I was discharged and got to celebrate my son's summer birthday with some family that had come down to see me in the hospital. Then the waiting game began.

- **August 15 – The Diagnosis**  
I was refreshing the portal every few hours I wasn't seeing any pathology yet. Then I got a phone call telling me  my pathology finally came back, Classical Hodgkin's Lympoma. I read the report carefully. After an hour or so, I was inundated with calls from oncologist and nurses to schedule more tests to get ready for treatment. I was assured by one Dr. "You got a 'good' cancer that we can cure". This phone call left me full of mixed emotions. I had two friends that both had this exact same diagnosis years earlier. I gave them a call. 

We had been planning for this eventuality. Coming up was a move back to our hometown so we could have help and get the treatment we needed. I am extremely lucky I come from a place with excellent cancer research facilities. St. Louis city has a long and tragic relationship with cancer and public health. Cold water creek is one of the worst environental disasters in all of US history. Waste from the Manhattan Project was incorrectly disposed and contaminated the entire northern half of the city. It seems unlikely that this is where my cancer had developed since I had not been living in the city for over 12 years and grew up far south of the contamination. There is no way of me knowing where this came from and it is also impossible to [prevent](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646). 

- **August 20 – PET Scan**  
PET scan came back showing exactly what stage I was in: stage 2 and non-bulky. We caught it fairly early. Even a late diagnosis of this disease typically has good outcomes for patients my age. The swelling from the surgery is starting to hurt and become more uncomfortable.

- **Birthday**  
I went to a tiki bar with a few friends to get some tacos and N/A drinks to celebrate my birthday and say goodbye before taking off to St. Louis. I was able to go bouldering with Adrienne, Nate, Hannah, and our sons one afternoon as well. I kept things very chill since my neck was hurting. 

- **August 27 – Oncologist Meeting**  
Got into a clinical trial that will hopefully let me do immunotherapy. It is a 50/50 shot since it is a study. For the first time, there was a clear path forward. I will have to do at least 2 months of chemo. I have finally been given medicine to help the itching and the swelling in my neck. My wife has been the best advocate and I am so grateful she got me transferred to Siteman. 


- **August 29 – First time climbing on ropes again**  
A friend and accomplished climber I hadn't seen in a decade reached out to me. We met up at Climb SoILL downtown and did some top rope together. Thank you for that afternoon Jackson, you are a legend.

## September: Chemo-day 
- **September 3 – Chemo Begins**  
The first day of treatment. Hoping it goes well.

This summer has been a blur. I am grateful I got to see so many friends, go on adventures, celebrate wins at work, and spend a lot of time with family. I love you all and thank you for all of the love and support you have given me.
