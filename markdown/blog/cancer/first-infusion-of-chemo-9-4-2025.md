# My First Chemotheropy Infusion

---

## **September 4 â€“ the Day After**  

Yesterday was crazy. I have never been more zonked in my life.
I had the weirdest chemo dreams. One where I fealt like I was sleeping on a boat and couldn't move. The other I fealt like I was shot.
The infusions went well overall. The only uncomfortable part was the last bag, Dacarbazine. It takes an hour
and feels a little burny going in. Staying hydrated has definitely been
key as well as taking my anti-nausea pills as soon as I feel nasuea coming on. 
My vision feels a little slow and slightly blurry.

Yesterday I managed to get a walks in with my brother and this morning I even wrote some code for an iOS widget.
Last night I talked with a few friends on the phone (hi, Autumn).
Honestly, this isn't as bad as I thought it would be so far. I know the
effects build up with each treatment, but now that I've gone through the
first one, my anxiety has gone way down. Some of the cancer
symptoms have eased up, like the severe itching and the sweatiness.

### The Infusion Experience

-   First chemo (ABVD) on September 3rd.
-   Was nervous going in.
-   Almost passed out at the blood draw due to anxiety.
-   Doctors were really reassuring.
-   The facilities were nice and I felt comfortable during treatment. Siteman rocks.
-   The last drug really took it out of me.
-   Main Side effects: tiredness, metallic taste in my mouth, nausea.

## Chemo Fun Facts

During treatment, I learned a couple of strange but kind of cool facts
about the drugs:

- Adriamycin comes from Italian soil near a castle.
- The "B" drug (Bleomycin) comes from a flower in Madagascar.
