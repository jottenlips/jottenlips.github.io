# Eco Micro Recipes

## Almond Milk ü•õ

Blend 1 tbsp almond butter to 1 cup water. You can also experiment with other nut varieties. Cashew milk is my favorite for coffee and tea. Peanut butter milk is amazing in chocolate granola or cereal.

## Microwave Popcorn üçø

Get a big glass bowl.
Put 3 tbsp of kernels into the bowl.

Season and Enjoy.

Buying kernels in bulk is a great way to have an eco snack.
