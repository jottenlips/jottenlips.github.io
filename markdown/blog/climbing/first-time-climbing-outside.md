I have a long history with rock climbing going back to high school. On fridays Mr. See, who taught math at SLUH, would take students climbing at Upper Limits downton by Union Station. I made some friends in the club that were much better than me and who had done outdoor trips. This sparked my curiousty at the time, but I had a lot of other things to focus on, like getting into music school. That combined with bruising my ribs on a boulder made me put the idea of climbing outside on the back burner. 

I completely forgot about rock climbing in college. It was something that I "used to do". I never really had time for the college gym, and memberships outside of school were a bit pricey.

A couple years after school, I finally had the disposable income and time to get back into it. I think I climbed like 30 v0s until my hands were all bloody the first time back. I was definitely bit by the climbing bug again. 

Then the pandemic hit, suddenly I was back to not climbing indoors. I started watching a lot of videos of people climbing outdoors on YouTube
