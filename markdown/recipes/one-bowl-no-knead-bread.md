# One bowl dutch oven no-knead bread recipe

Based on the NYT no-knead recipe, simplified.

Ingredients:

>- 430-435 grams of all-purpose flour

>- 4-6 grams of yeast

>- 6 grams salt

>- 345 grams of water, about 1 1/2 cups

>- cornmeal for coating the dough ball

Tools:

>- large bowl with cover or plate

>- dutch oven

>- spatula

>- knife

## Mix

Put the first three dry ingredients together in a bowl, zeroing out the scale as you go.
Next, add the water. 
Mix until shaggy.
Wait for 12 hours or longer.

## Fold

Use a spatula to fold the dough from the top and again from the sides.
Slice the top with a sharp knife.
Let rest for 15 min while you preheat oven to 450 F.

## Bake

Pour cornmeal on top of the dough ball. Use a spatula to flip the dough ball and add more cornmeal. 
Add a light dusting to the bottom of your dutch oven.
Bake covered for 35 minutes.
Take the cover off and bake again for 15-25, depending on how dark you want the loaf.

Once you take it out of the oven, let it rest for at least 30 minutes.

🍞 Enjoy! 🥖

## Bonus tip

You can mix tiny seeds into the dough at the dry ingredient stage or cover the loaf with seeds before baking.
I like to use hemp seeds since they are small and nutritious.
