        <h1 id="The-Summer-I-Got-Cancer">The Summer I Got Cancer</h1>

<p>This is a detailed account of how I learned I had cancer. This is mostly for me, to process the events that have happened this summer. I never thought I would be someone who gets cancer young. I worked out regularly, ate well, could run 10k, climb hard, and always felt like I had an endless pool of energy to pull from.</p>
<p><hr/></p>
<h2 id="May-Something-is-Off">May: Something is Off</h2>

<p><strong>May ‚Äì Dad sickness?</strong></p>
<p>This entire month I was off and on sick. I‚Äôd get sick, start to feel better, then something else would come up. Mostly sinus issues and fatigue. When the rest of the family got sick, they were out for a day or two. I would feel crummy the whole week.</p>
<p>I noticed some pain on my left side when weightlifting at the YMCA. I decided to start taking it easy. At first I dropped weight, then eventually stopped going. I still rock climbed casually when I wasn‚Äôt feeling sick. I made it out to the Obed with the family and a couple of friends this month. It was my first time climbing outside since becoming a new dad. We had a blast and our baby loved seeing the chickens and live music at the Lilly Pad.</p>

<h2 id="June-The-First-Signs">June: The First Signs</h2>

<p><strong>June 15 ‚Äì Father‚Äôs Day</strong></p>
<p>This month was much like May. It started with something viral, then the symptoms subsided, and I was able to go to Mammoth Cave on Father‚Äôs Day to do the Frozen Niagara tour. The cave was beautiful and the family had a great time. A couple of days later, I took a turn for the worse and developed a bacterial infection. My primary care physician referred to this as a ‚Äúdouble sickening.‚Äù</p>

<img src='https://github.com/jottenlips/jottenlips.github.io/blob/main/finding-out-8-30-2025-img/mammothcave2.JPG?raw=true' alt='extrasmall' /></p>
<p> <strong>June 20 ‚Äì Urgent Care</strong></p>
<p>I finally went to urgent care after a pretty bad ear infection. I was given steroids and antibiotics. The ear infection cleared, but my lymph nodes stayed enlarged.</p>
<p><strong>June 23 ‚Äì Doctor‚Äôs Appointment</strong></p>
<p>I had already scheduled a doctor‚Äôs appointment before urgent care. This was the soonest they could see me. I went in even though I felt fine. My symptoms had mostly subsided, besides some minor lymph node swelling.</p>
<p><strong>June 29 ‚Äì the Obed</strong></p>
<p>I woke up super early and met my good friend and belay partner at his house. We drove out to the wild and scenic Obed for a beautiful day of rock climbing, hiking, and swimming. I was projecting <em>Heresy</em> and finally got to the chains. Thank you for the beta Nate! I hope to send it clean one day.</p>
<p>On our hike out of the Y12 area, I became extremely fatigued after climbing a ladder. I bent over for 2‚Äì3 minutes to catch my breath. It was a warm summer day and we had heavy packs, but this was not typical behavior for me. After catching my breath, the rest of the day was fine. We got home early in the afternoon and I hung out with my wife and baby.</p>

<h2 id="July-Symptoms-Worsen">July: Symptoms Worsen</h2>

<p><strong>July 12 ‚Äì Band Practice</strong></p>
<p>The bumps were still on my neck and collarbone. My friend Willa asked where I wanted to stand for band practice. I told her I needed to sit down since I couldn‚Äôt wear a guitar strap. I showed her the bumps. She said I should get it checked out. I had already scheduled an appointment for early next week. Other symptoms were starting to interfere with daily life, like full-body itching. Band practice went well and I hope I can play Drew&#39;s rehersal dinner in September.</p>
<p><strong>July 14 ‚Äì Google</strong></p>
<p>When I googled my symptoms, the same thing kept coming up: lymphoma. I texted my friends about it, and they calmed me down. Google will tell you the worst-case scenario typically.</p>
<p><strong>July 15 ‚Äì Ultrasound &amp; Appointment</strong></p>
<p>I went in for my appointment and told my doctor about the symptoms. She said it looked like a drastic change from the previous month and thought it might be a mix of a new allergy and anxiety from being sick. I went for an ultrasound that day.</p>
<p><img src='https://github.com/jottenlips/jottenlips.github.io/blob/main/finding-out-8-30-2025-img/lymphnode.png?raw=true' alt='extrasmall' /></p>
<p><strong>July 22‚Äì23 ‚Äì Telehealth Call &amp; Ultrasound Results</strong></p>
<p>The ultrasound results came back strange. The radiologist suggested it was simply a vascular complex or some congenital vascular disorder. But I had pictures of my neck from a January trip to Mexico. I definitely wasn‚Äôt born with this. I asked my doctor to schedule a CT. It wasn‚Äôt expedited since the ultrasound didn‚Äôt look urgent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continued life as normal, fighting through symptoms. The allergist had me increase my antihistamine dosage, which helped mask the itching for a while.</p>
<p>At work, we finally launched our new mobile app, a goal we had been working on all year. Getting it out into the world was a big source of relief, joy, and satisfaction. Mentally I felt positive, enjoying time with teammates who had flown in from all over the world for a product summit. Physically, I was rough. My shoulder and neck were worsening and other symptoms were developing. That night I flew to St. Louis, then drove to Wisconsin for a family vacation. I hoped a week in the fresh north woods air would fix my immune system and calm my health anxiety.</p>

<h2 id="August-Waiting-and-Diagnosis">August: Waiting and Diagnosis</h2>

<p><strong>August 4 ‚Äì CT Scan</strong></p>
<p>I went in for my CT scan. It was the children‚Äôs underwater-themed one, which made me cry.</p>
<p><strong>August 5 ‚Äì Coughing Blood</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Holy shit, I need to go to the ER&quot;. After calming down, I took my wife‚Äôs car and went to the ER while she took our son to daycare.</p>
<p><strong>August 5 ‚Äì Hospital Stay</strong></p>
<p>I was admitted. They put a camera down my throat, did another CT, and found a mass in my chest and neck. It was in a place they couldn‚Äôt surgically remove. Over the next four days, I had two surgical biopsies and met several oncologists and cancer specialists. They also tested me for infections since I‚Äôd recently been in caves. One possibility was histoplasmosis, but with all the oncologists around, I had the feeling they already knew.</p>
<p>My friends Roman, Eve, and Scott came to visit and keep me company as well as my little brother and family which made the days go by a bit quicker. I am also thankful for all the phone calls that kept my mind off of things. My older brother called me everyday.</p>
<p>The allergist also called me before one surgery. Apparently, I have Alpha-Gal and am allergic to red meat.</p>
<p>I was discharged in time to celebrate my son‚Äôs birthday with family who had come down to see me in the hospital. Then the waiting game began.</p>
<p><strong>August 15 ‚Äì The Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>I was refreshing the portal every few hours for ten days, but never got the pathology report. Then I got the call. The Dr. began describing Classical Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphoma and how they were very thorough in the pathology. It is rare and difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The pathology report showed up in the portal. I read the report carefully. Within an hour, I was inundated with calls from oncologists and nurses to schedule tests for treatment. One doctor told me, ‚ÄúYou got a <em>good</em> cancer that we can cure. You&#39;re in good hands.‚Äù It left me with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>Two of my friends from college had the same diagnosis years earlier as well as another family member. I called them and they were extermely helpful.</p>
<p>My wife and I had been planning for this diagnosis already. We decided to move back to our hometown for family help and treatment. I‚Äôm extremely lucky to come from a place with excellent cancer research facilities.</p>
<p>St. Louis has a long, tragic history with cancer and public health. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwater_Creek_(Missouri_river_tributary)'>The Mallinckrodt Coldwater Creek Nuclear Waste Site</a> is one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. Weapons grade nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project contaminated the northern half of the county. It seems unlikely my cancer came from there since I haven‚Äôt lived in St. Louis for over 12 years and grew up far south of the contamination. There‚Äôs no way to know where it came from and <a href='https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646'>there&#39;s no way to prevent Hodgkin lymphoma</a>.</p>
<p><strong>August 20 ‚Äì PET Scan</strong></p>
<p>The PET scan showed stage 2, non-bulky. We caught it fairly early. Even late diagnoses in patients my age tend to have good outcomes. The swelling from surgery was starting to hurt more.</p>
<p><img src='https://github.com/jottenlips/jottenlips.github.io/blob/main/finding-out-8-30-2025-img/cancerpet.png?raw=true' alt='extrasmall' /></p>
<p><strong>Birthday</strong></p>
<p>I went to a tiki bar with friends for tacos and N/A drinks to celebrate my birthday and say goodbye before moving to St. Louis. I also went bouldering with Adrienne, Nate, Hannah, and our babies the day before. I kept it chill since my neck hurt. My friend Kenny was back from tour and fixed a few of my guitar pedals as well. You all made it such a special birthday.</p>
<p><strong>August 27 ‚Äì Oncologist Meeting</strong></p>
<p>I got into a clinical trial that might let me try immunotherapy. It‚Äôs a 50/50 chance since it‚Äôs a study. I‚Äôll need at least two months of chemo and likely 6 months of total treatment. Finally, I was given medicine to help with itching and swelling. My wife has been the best advocate, and I‚Äôm eternally grateful she got me transferred to Siteman Cancer Center.</p>
<p><strong>August 29 ‚Äì First Time Climbing on Ropes Again</strong></p>
<p>A friend and accomplished climber I hadn‚Äôt seen in a decade reached out. We met up at Climb So iLL downtown and climbed together. Thank you, Jackson, you‚Äôre a legend.</p>

<h2 id="September-Treatment">September: Treatment</h2>

<p><strong>September 3 ‚Äì Chemo</strong></p>
<p>The first day of treatment. Hoping it goes well.</p>
<p><hr/>This summer has had a lot of ups and downs. I‚Äôm grateful I got to see so many friends, go on adventures, celebrate wins at work, and spend time with family. I am also super appreciative of everyone that has helped me especially my wonderful doctors and surgeons. I love you all and thank you for the love and support you‚Äôve given me. Everyday is a gift.</p>
