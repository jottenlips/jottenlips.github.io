<h2 id="September-4-the-Day-After"><strong>September 4 ‚Äì the Day After</strong></h2>

<p>Yesterday was crazy. I have never been more zonked in my life.
I had the weirdest chemo dreams after falling asleep to Lord of the Rings. One where I fealt like I was sleeping on a boat and couldn&#39;t move. The other I fealt like I was shot.
The infusions went well overall. The only uncomfortable part was the last bag, Dacarbazine. It takes an hour
and feels a little burny going in. Staying hydrated has definitely been
key as well as taking my anti-nausea pills as soon as I feel nasuea coming on. 
My vision feels a little slow and slightly blurry.</p>
<p>Last night I managed to get a walk in with my brother and talk with a few friends on the phone (hi, Autumn).
This morning I even wrote some code for an iOS widget.
Honestly, this isn&#39;t as bad as I thought it would be so far. I know the
effects build up with each treatment, but now that I&#39;ve gone through the
first one, my anxiety has gone way down. Some of the cancer
symptoms have eased up, like the severe itching and the sweatiness. Thank you my fellow &quot;LympHomies&quot; for sharing your experiences. It has really helped me deal with the side effects so far. Hopefully the rest of the week goes as easy as today.</p>

<ul><li><p>First chemo (ABVD) on September 3rd.</p>
</li><li><p>Was nervous going in.</p>
</li><li><p>Almost passed out at the blood draw due to anxiety.</p>
</li><li><p>Doctors were really reassuring.</p>
</li><li><p>The facilities were nice and I felt comfortable during treatment. Siteman rocks.</p>
</li><li><p>The last drug really took it out of me.</p>
</li><li><p>Main Side effects: tiredness, metallic taste in my mouth, nausea.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="Chemo-Fun-Facts">Chemo Fun Facts</h2>

<p>During treatment, I learned a couple of strange but kind of cool facts
about the drugs:</p>
<ul><li><p>Adriamycin comes from Italian soil bacteria discovered near a castle over looking the Adriatic Sea.</p>
</li><li><p>The &quot;B&quot; drug (Bleomycin) comes from a flower in Madagascar. My MIL took my son to the botanical garden in St. Louis during my treatment and they found this fact on a plaque in the greenhouse!</p>
</li></ul>
